## Features

Add Chefs: Users can input up to three chef names in the form and store their data using localStorage. This data is carried forward for task assignments.

Task Assignment: The system allows chefs to be randomly or manually assigned to different cooking tasks. Tasks are broken down into steps, and each step is assigned to a chef.

Real-Time Step Management: Users can dynamically add or remove cooking steps, set timers for each step, and assign chefs to specific tasks.

Sortable Task List: Users can reorder the steps in the task list using drag-and-drop functionality powered by SortableJS, ensuring flexible task management.

Ingredient Management: The recipe pages include a feature to add, delete, and refresh ingredients. Predefined ingredients can be edited, and custom ingredients can be added as needed.

Save and Analyze Recipe Links: Users can input a recipe link, save it for later, and analyze the recipe by redirecting to the main task management page (index.html).

Design: The application is built with Bootstrap 5.

Customizable Timers: Users can adjust the time for each step in the cooking process, helping to keep track of tasks during the cooking session.

Data Persistence: Chefs' names are stored in localStorage, allowing for persistence across pages during the session.
